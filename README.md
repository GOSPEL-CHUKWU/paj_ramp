# paj_ramp

Paj Ramp is a crypto offramp API designed to allow users to convert Solana-based digital assets to fiat and transfer the resulting funds to traditional bank accounts. This backend service acts as a bridge between the Solana blockchain and the traditional banking system, enabling secure, authenticated, and user-friendly offboarding of funds from Web3 to Web2.
