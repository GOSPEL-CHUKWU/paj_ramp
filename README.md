# paj_ramp

Paj Ramp is a crypto offramp API designed to allow users to convert Solana-based digital assets to fiat and transfer the resulting funds to traditional bank accounts. This backend service acts as a bridge between the Solana blockchain and the traditional banking system, enabling secure, authenticated, and user-friendly offboarding of funds from Web3 to Web2.

> *A simple wrapper for communicating with paj_ramp's backend endpoints — no manual API calls required.*

### *“Send SOL. Get Naira.”*
> *The goal is to let users withdraw their crypto holdings from a Solana wallet and receive fiat currency in their linked bank accounts — all through a simple, authenticated API integration.*
